purple-bitly -- Bit.ly Short URL Plugin for libpurple/Pidgin - TESTING DEMO DO NOT MERGE
by John Bellone <jb@thunkbrightly.com>

SUMMARY
	This plugin was designed during the snow storm of December 2009. The
purpose of the plugin is simple: I wanted the ability to use my bit.ly account
to shorten a URL that I want to send to a friend during an instant messenger
conversation. Because the bit.ly service includes access to the stellar REST
API over HTTP I was able to develop this very quickly.

    	 Pidgin plugins are quite easy to install, but a little bit more of
a pain in the ass to actually get compiled. The documentation is a little
sparse (and outdated) but the gentlemen (and women) on the Pidgin IRC channel
got me up to speed better than any Wiki could ever. Kudos for them for their
quick answers.
